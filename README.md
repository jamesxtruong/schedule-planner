Welcome to the Schedule Planner Program!

Created by: James Truong for CS302	Winter 2023

To compile and update all files use the command: make all
To run the Schedule Planner Program after 'make all' enter: ./prog3

This program uses a menu interface using integer inputs to navigate the menu. 
If non intger is entered or one that is not within range, it will prompt for another input.

This program helps manage events into a schedule! The three events you can add are:
meeting, workshop, and convention.

All of these events have names (title), a date, and a location. But there are unique differences
between each event type. You can enter the date any way you prefer, but keep it consistent so it
is easy for you to refer when you view it again!

A meeting has a meeting topic.

A workshop has a capacity for participants and an instructor.

A convention has a sponsor and admission price.

These are the different information for those events you can input and display.

The menu options currently available for use are to add an event, display all events, and 
remove events. Some special features have not yet been implemented. 

Happy planning!
